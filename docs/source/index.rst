Welcome to PyFPT's documentation!
==============================================

This is the documentation for a Python/Cython package to run first-passage time (FPT) simulations using importance sampling. This package will let you numerically investigate the tail of the PDF for first passage times for potential in slow-roll inflation.

This package also comes with functionality to compare the numerical results with analytical expectations.
